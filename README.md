# OpenRune-Developer-Tools

Standalone sideloaded plugin for RuneLite-based clients. Runs a local MCP server
(default `http://127.0.0.1:7780/mcp`) so AI tools like Claude can screenshot
interfaces, inspect widgets/NPCs/objects/items, drive input (click, drag, type,
dialogue) and read script/var/projectile/chat history. Live activity dashboard
at `http://127.0.0.1:7780/` shows every AI tool call with args, results and
screenshots.

## Build and deploy

Local builds compile against the Fluxious client's shaded jar (build it first
with `gradlew :runelite-client:shadowJar`; override the path with
`-PfluxClientJar=...`). Without it, the build falls back to the upstream
RuneLite client artifact.

```
gradlew jar
```

The jar automatically deploys to each client's sideload folder:

- `~/.runelite/sideloaded-plugins/`
- `~/.rsprox/sideloaded-plugins/`
- `~/.fluxious/sideloaded-plugins/`

Start the client with `--developer-mode`, enable **OpenRune-DeveloperTools**,
then connect Claude:

```
claude mcp add --transport http flux http://127.0.0.1:7780/mcp
```

## Dashboard

While the plugin is running, `http://127.0.0.1:7780/` serves a live activity
dashboard — open it in a browser to watch what the AI is doing in real time:

![Live activity dashboard](docs/dashboard.png)

- Every MCP tool call as it happens: tool name, arguments as chips, duration,
  timestamp, with slow calls (>1s) and errors highlighted.
- Results inline: JSON pretty-printed and collapsible, screenshots as thumbnails
  with a click-to-zoom lightbox.
- Header stats for the session: total calls, errors, average duration, live
  connection indicator.
- Filter by tool via dropdown, errors-only toggle, pause/resume, follow
  (auto-scroll) and clear.

The page polls `GET /log?after=<id>` (same port) for new entries; the server keeps
the last 100 calls in memory, so refreshing the page replays recent history.

## Releases

Pushing to the `prod` branch builds the jar and publishes a GitHub release
automatically.
